option is a pack that contains 1 key and 2 locks for people who want to try it out and the second option is to buy the pack that contains 4 locks but no key for those who already bought the starter kit and happened to like the product  So make sure you really read the description of what you re getting if you re buying online   This one happens do be the 4 locks with no key so you might want to try the starter kit first   I actually rec  it because UNFORTUNATELY the lock doesn t work with all situations because of draw designs  Then on top of that Kidco also sells the key seperately with no locks for those who have the product  love it  and happened to misplace or lose their key OR want to purchase an additional incase they ever lose the 1st key  I will admit that I think it s pretty lame for a company to try to squeeze every penny out of you especially when it probaby only costs 5 cents to make the darn key and especially when you re dealing with child safety products  As far as how well the product works   I LOVE IT and wish it had worked out better with all my draw situations  It s especially great for those cabinet doors that stand alone and don t have another door next to it where you can just buy one of those wrap around door knob locks that require 2 knobs to be side by side  I didn t have as great of luck with my kitchen draws because the draw panel is added on to the actual draw so it isn t flush with where you put the catch  I put 5 stars to bring the rating up because the last reviewer only gave one and it s actually a great product  I know it will outsmart my baby far beyond any cheaper options out there  I installed them with the adhesive tape that comes with it but I plan on reattaching it with the screws also included because I personally feel that the screws will do a better job AND because I love my child more than my freaking cabinet doors for all those worried about messing up your precious wood cabinets   I mean give me a break   the holes are so small anyway and it s totally concealed  only you will know it s there  ALSO  this locks so tight that little fingers hands can t reach inside small openings  which usually occures with the

option is to buy the pack that contains 4 locks but no key for those who already bought the starter kit and happened to like the product  So make sure you really read the description of what you re getting if you re buying online   This one happens do be the 4 locks with no key so you might want to try the starter kit first   I actually rec  it because UNFORTUNATELY the lock doesn t work with all situations because of draw designs  Then on top of that Kidco also sells the key seperately with no locks for those who have the product  love it  and happened to misplace or lose their key OR want to purchase an additional incase they ever lose the 1st key  I will admit that I think it s pretty lame for a company to try to squeeze every penny out of you especially when it probaby only costs 5 cents to make the darn key and especially when you re dealing with child safety products  As far as how well the product works   I LOVE IT and wish it had worked out better with all my draw situations  It s especially great for those cabinet doors that stand alone and don t have another door next to it where you can just buy one of those wrap around door knob locks that require 2 knobs to be side by side  I didn t have as great of luck with my kitchen draws because the draw panel is added on to the actual draw so it isn t flush with where you put the catch  I put 5 stars to bring the rating up because the last reviewer only gave one and it s actually a great product  I know it will outsmart my baby far beyond any cheaper options out there  I installed them with the adhesive tape that comes with it but I plan on reattaching it with the screws also included because I personally feel that the screws will do a better job AND because I love my child more than my freaking cabinet doors for all those worried about messing up your precious wood cabinets   I mean give me a break   the holes are so small anyway and it s totally concealed  only you will know it s there

B-Ready Stroller, Black\t\"Some differences with Uppababy Vs. Britax B-Ready:WHEELS - Vista wins. Vista had better wheels. Vista had tread and were more grippery tire like feel.  B-Ready had smooth plastic feel to them. I can see that they would get all scratched up easily. B-Ready also had fenders on them which seem to add to bulk. Comparing closely it almost appear one could put Vista's wheels to B-Ready.  It's that similar!HANDLE - B-Ready wins. Handle on B-Ready was nicer than Vista. It pivoted instead of telescoping (which was what the Vista does). The center was had a grip that was molded for one-handed steering. The arms and wrist seem more comfortable (rested more parallel like on a keyboard). My wife at 5'2 found the Vista handle too high and wished it could adjust lower.FOLDING - Vista wins (barely). Comparing the two, the wife like the Vista (it did take several attempts for wife to get the feel for it, as did I ! Once figured out it was ok).B-Ready  required two hands as well but you sort of have to use your stomach so that you could pull the levers toward you and have  it collapse. I found it easy if you have larger hands you can pull down the levers easier but since my wife is 5'2, her hands are smaller and sort of used her stomach a bit.  With time, I think she could avoid using her stomach.  She would just hold the bar and use her fingers to pull down.  We also found that you had to straighten out the B-Ready's handle so that when you fold it, it would stand properly stand up and you could lock the folding clasp. DEFINITELY TRY FOLDING IT YOURSELF IN THE STORE! (just to add an another stroller, the Baby Jogger City Select has really easy folding capability!). Both stands up when folded although you have to consciously stand it up.  The sales person always seems to fold it and let it flop to the ground.  I doubt one  would do that outside.Note on second seat folding - The folding of the B-Ready allows the second seat to be on but it was very bulky (and heavy at a total of 35 lbs) and the canopy of the second seat would get dirty.  It's better to just remove the seat.MAIN SEAT - Vista wins. Vista has 0 degree seat position and B-Ready did not. Vista 2010 added this to address a common complaint.  B-Ready is slightly on the decline.  So while the  B-Ready has a handle that is more ergonomically correct for mom's wrist, it seems the seat upright capability is better for the kid. (previous Vista 2009 owners found the kid pulling themselves forward to get upright).SECOND SEAT (REAR) - B-Ready wins . Recline of 2nd child add on - B ready  was clearly better since it can recline to horizontal sleeping position. Vista had one position.  It was not upright but slightly tilted back.  More for a child chilling out and may nit be the best if kid is sleeping. The Vista seat was also closer to the front seat and B- Ready has more room for child in rear. A taller person may hit the B-Ready seat with their stride but I'm 5'10 and its not a problem.  Also, note that the B-Ready second seat is in the rear of parent behind main seat  FORWARD FACING whereas, Vista is in FRONT of main seat REAR FACING.  Big difference here!  I believe that's why the B-Ready can recline safely.  I don't think I would want to have a Vista recline in front and therefore exposing the child's head.STORAGE - B-Ready wins (barely).  B-Ready is accessible on all sides.  Vista's is on the rear only.  With the rear seat, this is important.  However, the Vista has a bar running across where the kid can sort of step their feet on.  The B-Ready has their feet in the entire basket and the kids would probably kick at your diaper bag.CONFIGURATIONS - B-Ready wins.  B-Ready has 14 configurations vs. Vista's 3 configurations.  Most notably are: B-Ready has ability to use two infant carriers at the same time.  You can also place infant carrier in the rear (Vista you cannot.  You can only put it in the front).  B-Ready can use the bassinet with the second seat.  Vista cannot use bassinet with rear seat.After all this, I am still having problems deciding.  For me, it comes down to Vista's 0 degree position but no full recline in rear seat Vs. B-Ready's full recline rear seat but lack of 0 degree position.Edit:Update - I ended up buying the Britax B-ready.  It's been used it for 6 weeks now.  So far, its been great!  Very nice, easy ride.  It can be bumpy on cobble stones and uneven surfaces.  If you want a smoother ride on these surfaces, you'll need bigger, air-filled tires.  My complaint is the unfolding part.  When unfolding, the plastic clip that holds the stroller , is tricky to \"\"undo\"\" so you can unfold it.  You need to pull it out a bit before you unfold which can be tough.  I think we'll need more practice at doing this.  I'll report back in a few more months.\"\t1.0\t[-263.7286210856005,263.7286210856005]\t1.0\nBABYBJORN Travel Crib Light , Blue\tBOTTOM LINE: I would buy this again in a heart-beat and I would buy it over any other travel crib or pack n' play. I have been so impressed with this crib. 100% worth every penny!! It has been used every night for seven months and shows no signs of wear!My husband and I bought this crib as our only crib for our first baby. We were nervous because it was such a large purchase for us. (This is the most expensive thing we have purchased besides our car.) After extensive research we decided on the babybjorn because my husband is in graduate school and we will be doing a lot of moving in the next few years. She has slept in it since she was three days old and she is now seven months and the crib looks and functions as if it was new!Our BabyBjorn has been in six states and five countries. We have checked it at airports all over Europe and the US. We have checked it in its carrying case alone and it has not been damaged in anyway. It has been on trains, buses, metros, trams, in taxis, cars, and planes! Even the bag has yet to show signs of wearing.The crib unzips from the metal bars so it can be washed as well. This is really nice if you travel a lot. We moved into our apartment in Italy and found out that there were bed bugs in it! We were worried we would have to replace our loved crib but it can be washed and the matress is cased in plastic so it is safe. (The plastic liner can unzip and both the matress and the plastic can be washed.) If you are planning on doing any extensive traveling you will run into bed bugs and this crib is a must.The sheets and matress pad made by babybjorn are expensive however I found them for half the price at sheetworld.com. And we were able to get hot pink cotton ones and hot pink flannel ones.The crib is so easy to put together. I personally hate setting things up but it is one motion - just lifting it out of the case! It also comes ready-to-go so no need to put together. It even is easy to put back into its case. Amazingly, seven months plus six countries later it still opens up perfectly everytime.I love that I can see into it so easily through the mesh. Being a first time mom I was super nervous when she slept but I could see her without lifting my head off the pillow. Also, our little one moves a lot while she sleeps and sometimes ends up pressed against the side. Luckily the babybjorn is light fabric so she can breath while her face is planted into the side. Another great thing is that all the bars are outside of the crib so there is nothing hard for her little head to hit.Durning the night she sleeps in it and during the day she plays in it. Unlike pack n' plays the bottom will not sag because the matress is supported by the floor.Also, it is small enough to fit in tight hotel rooms and even on some trains but large enough to provide comfort and space for even the most wiggley babies! The carrying case is also slim enough for us to pack it on the floor of our Saturn in front of her car seat. It even was smashed in our trunk from Washington DC to Idaho and worked just fine when we pulled it out.Two things about it to keep in mind. The crib sits on the floor so it is cooler at the lower elevation than a traditonal crib. Also, I had a c-section and it was difficult for the first week to bend over and lift her out of it. However the crib has been built well enough that I do lean on it to grab her and it has not had any issues.It is hands down the best purchase we made. Although it is a bit pricey it is worth every penny. I would pay twice what it cost for it. I have told friends to buy it. I will buy another all over again.\t1.0\t[-257.7744231071574,257.7744231071574]\t1.0\nButtons Cloth Diaper Cover - One Size - 8 Color Options\tWe are big Best Bottoms fans here, but I wanted to try these as a cheaper option to designate for daycare use. They are well made, super soft in feel, with gentle waist elastics, and snug leg elastics. The leg elastics initially caused red marks on my super chubby thighed baby, but since he's trimmed down with crawling, that's no longer an issue and I now appreciate the snugger fit.Compared to Best Bottoms, I prefer these for the soft stretchy feel, but still get a better fit with our Best Bottoms (so I tend to reach for the Best Bottoms more often). Best Bottoms give a better fit because they have one additional rise setting (4 instead of just 3 rise options). Fewer rise options on the Buttons inevitably leads to more awkward in-between size stages where one is too snug and the other looks (or really is) huge. Our Best Bottoms always look nice and trim. Buttons do, too, but only when the fit is right, and that is less frequently with the Buttons. We've gotten around the in-between stage by unsnapping the outer two snaps in the rise completely on the Buttons covers to allow more room in the legs, but leaving the middle rise snap snapped down to pull up all the excess material. It still looks a bit sloppy, but it works, and looks / fits better than being 100% on the largest rise.The inserts: We have small, medium, large best bottom inserts in hemp/cotton as well as stay dry. All are compatible with Buttons, although they can be a bit stubborn snapping in, but they do snap in. The larges are a hair big for the Buttons covers in my opinion, but you can make them fit on the largest rise if you need to. I definitely prefer to use the medium Best Bottom inserts or the Buttons large inserts on the middle and large rise with Buttons.The large Buttons inserts we got to try are super soft, seem just as absorbent as our Best Bottoms but more flexible and bunch a bit more, though it's not caused any problems for us. They are in-between the medium and large Best Bottom stay dry sizes. Just as wide at the ends. As wide in the middle as the Best Bottom larges. Wider than the Best Bottom mediums. Just thought I'd share if anyone was wondering how they compare.I'd definitely recommend the Buttons covers and inserts to anyone looking to try an AI2 system at an affordable price-point. Although I still prefer our Best Bottoms, for the price, I'll definitely be adding more Buttons to our stash, especially now that they've added some cool new colors and prints :-)\t1.0\t[-251.2402412961459,251.2402412961459]\t1.0\nBaby K'tan Baby Carrier, Black, X-Large\tCheck and recheck the K'Tan for size issues before letting your guard down and wearing.....

Several people reported that this car seat was so snug that, in some cases, it actually harmed their baby. In one instance, an individual claimed that the seat was so restrictive that it would not even fit their newborn. Having used the carrier myself, I now believe that the product has been altered since those reviews were written, those reviewers did not read the user&#8217;s manual, and/or those folks were just out to write a negative review for what is actually an amazing product. It is true that the Maxi Cosi Prezi is cozy; but cozy in a warm hug way, not in a reticulated python way.We received this seat late in the game. My child was already 18 pounds 6 ounces and 27 and-a-half inches long. Not a huge baby, but much larger than the newborn that others claimed having trouble squeezing into the seat. He fit like a glove, and loved it. Yes, I did have to adjust the straps and take out the included newborn wedge, which required almost no effort compared to some carriers. This adjustment, however, would be required of any baby carrier unless it just happened to be adjusted to the size of one&#8217;s child right out of the box.Our other carrier is the Britax Chaperone, and is my point of comparison. After making the mistake of originally purchasing a much cheaper carrier prior to my child&#8217;s birth, I can confidently say that both the Britax and the Maxi Cosi are of superior material and build quality than carriers on the lower end of the cost scale. I only mention this because I am admittedly and, if you ask my wife, painfully cheap. Nonetheless, there is a discernable difference in quality for the price in this case. When one&#8217;s child is involved, in my opinion, it is worth the extra expense.One feature present on the Maxi Cosi that originally prompted me to purchase the Britax, is a rear impact bar (I think Maxi Cosi refers to it as an anti-rebound bar) on the car seat base. While it blows my mind that this feature is not required on all infant car seats, it is only seen on a couple of models. The purpose of this bar is that of preventing the rear-facing car seat from smashing the contained baby&#8217;s head and face against the seat of the car it is attached to in a rear impact, or recoil from front impact, situation. For first time parents, I recommend that you try some car seats without this feature in your own car (without a baby in it, of course) and see for yourself how easily the base and seat fold up against the seat they are attached to if the weight is shifted as it would be in a rear impact scenario. Then try the seats with the bar. Again, ridiculous that this feature is not a requirement. Big points for both this seat and the Chaperone.The primary difference, in my book, between my two favorite car seats &#8211; this seat and the Chaperone &#8211; is that the Maxi Cosi is substantially lighter than the Chaperone. The Chaperone&#8217;s big claim being safety, I just cannot say for sure whether any safety is sacrificed for the sake of weight. Other differences include the multiple travel systems offered by Britax for Britax carriers, whereas it seems that Maxi Cosi is following more of a universal adapter approach. It might seem insignificant but the Prezi also has this piece of elastic fabric that stretches across the infant occupant&#8217;s feet that seems to produce a calming effect. Very nice. The same type of fabric serves as the European style canopy. My wife prefers this canopy, I do not.All in all, I believe the Maxi Cosi Prezi is a legitimate top tier product that easily competes with the trusted standards in the industry. As far as comfort is concerned, I have not personally seen a carrier that my own child has looked more comfortable in. In my opinion, any claims that the Maxi Cosi Prezi is too cozy are simply false within the context of the recommended weight and height restrictions.\t1.0\t[-233.6875590945047,233.6875590945047]\t1.0\nPura Stainless Kiki Sippy Bottle Stainless Steel, 11 Ounce, Natural\tWe have four of these bottles for our twins - one plain stainless, as well as green, pink and aqua bottles.  We love them: they are eco-friendly, sturdy, attractive and durable, and the colours allow our twins to distinguish which bottle is theirs.However, my kids don't like the Pura sippy spouts.  Instead we started out using Mam wide mouth nipples, then transitioned to Avent sippy spouts.  I would really like it if there were a silicone straw top option for these sippy cups -Zo-li Bot Straw Sippy Cupsare the best straw option I have found, but those cups are plastic.Addressing some criticisms in other reviews (here and in reviews for other finishes):1) Liquid measurements - The interior of the bottle is marked in ounces and mL.  It is hard to see the markings when the bottle is empty, but as soon as you start filling it with milk any overhead light reflects off the surface of the milk and makes it much easier to see the markings.  I've found that with time I got very good at estimating amounts just by glancing into the bottle.  If you really need to track every half ounce that your child consumes, stainless bottles are not going to be the best option.2) Heat transfer / durability - We useSiliskinsto cover our bottles, protect our children's hands from heat and cold, and protect the bottles from dings when they are inevitably dropped.  At the time I got my bottles the Pura skins weren't available through Amazon.  Our bottles have endured numerous drops from toddler height and from a 42 inch high counter and they are as good as new.3) Paint flaking - This has been noted as an issue by some reviewers who used the coloured bottles.  Well, we did an A/B test... my son has nails like Wolverine and sure enough he scratched his bottles; my daughter is far more gentle and has never scratched her bottles.  Choose a stainless or coloured bottle according to your own child's tendencies...  The Siliskins also help to protect the paint since they prevent scratching.4) Silicone caps - at first these seemed weird but I grew to like them.  They do fit securely but aren't as secure as screw-on lids would be: I wouldn't recommend inverting the bottles and hoping that they don't leak.  The upside to not being rigid is that they squish easily into a pocket or corner of the diaper bag when you've taken them off the bottle, and with twins every square inch of space counts.This is a great product.  If I were adding to my wishlist of features and accessories I can only say it would also be nice to have a wider range of colours (Pura has added Grape to their line-up since we bought our bottles; yellow, red and orange would be great additions).  In addition to the straw top, as another reviewer mentioned, an adult sport spout would also be a great thing to have.  Pura could also offer screw-on stainless caps for people who hate the silicone caps.  Finally, since the colours are so attractive it seems a shame to cover them with coloured silicone covers - clear covers would allow the bottles to show through more attractively.\t1.0\t[-233.08469758394472,233.08469758394472]\t1.0\n","comment":"","msgTable":[[{"key":"review","value":"Britax B-Ready Stroller, Black"},{"key":"review","value":"\"Some differences with Uppababy Vs.

We also found that you had to straighten out the B-Ready's handle so that when you fold it, it would stand properly stand up and you could lock the folding clasp. DEFINITELY TRY FOLDING IT YOURSELF IN THE STORE! (just to add an another stroller, the Baby Jogger City Select has really easy folding capability!). Both stands up when folded although you have to consciously stand it up.  The sales person always seems to fold it and let it flop to the ground.  I doubt one  would do that outside.Note on second seat folding - The folding of the B-Ready allows the second seat to be on but it was very bulky (and heavy at a total of 35 lbs) and the canopy of the second seat would get dirty.  It's better to just remove the seat.MAIN SEAT - Vista wins. Vista has 0 degree seat position and B-Ready did not. Vista 2010 added this to address a common complaint.  B-Ready is slightly on the decline.  So while the  B-Ready has a handle that is more ergonomically correct for mom's wrist, it seems the seat upright capability is better for the kid. (previous Vista 2009 owners found the kid pulling themselves forward to get upright).SECOND SEAT (REAR) - B-Ready wins . Recline of 2nd child add on - B ready  was clearly better since it can recline to horizontal sleeping position. Vista had one position.  It was not upright but slightly tilted back.  More for a child chilling out and may nit be the best if kid is sleeping. The Vista seat was also closer to the front seat and B- Ready has more room for child in rear. A taller person may hit the B-Ready seat with their stride but I'm 5'10 and its not a problem.  Also, note that the B-Ready second seat is in the rear of parent behind main seat  FORWARD FACING whereas, Vista is in FRONT of main seat REAR FACING.  Big difference here!  I believe that's why the B-Ready can recline safely.  I don't think I would want to have a Vista recline in front and therefore exposing the child's head.STORAGE - B-Ready wins (barely).  B-Ready is accessible on all sides.  Vista's is on the rear only.  With the rear seat, this is important.  However, the Vista has a bar running across where the kid can sort of step their feet on.  The B-Ready has their feet in the entire basket and the kids would probably kick at your diaper bag.CONFIGURATIONS - B-Ready wins.  B-Ready has 14 configurations vs. Vista's 3 configurations.  Most notably are: B-Ready has ability to use two infant carriers at the same time.  You can also place infant carrier in the rear (Vista you cannot.  You can only put it in the front).  B-Ready can use the bassinet with the second seat.  Vista cannot use bassinet with rear seat.After all this, I am still having problems deciding.  For me, it comes down to Vista's 0 degree position but no full recline in rear seat Vs. B-Ready's full recline rear seat but lack of 0 degree position.Edit:Update - I ended up buying the Britax B-ready.  It's been used it for 6 weeks now.  So far, its been great!  Very nice, easy ride.  It can be bumpy on cobble stones and uneven surfaces.  If you want a smoother ride on these surfaces, you'll need bigger, air-filled tires.  My complaint is the unfolding part.  When unfolding, the plastic clip that holds the stroller , is tricky to \"\"undo\"\" so you can unfold it.  You need to pull it out a bit before you unfold which can be tough.  I think we'll need more practice at doing this.  I'll report back in a few more months.\""},{"key":"review","value":"1.0"},{"key":"review","value":"[-263.7286210856005,263.7286210856005]"},{"key":"review","value":"1.0"}],[{"key":"sentiment","value":"BABYBJORN Travel Crib Light , Blue"},{"key":"sentiment","value":"BOTTOM LINE: I would buy this again in a heart-beat and I would buy it over any other travel crib or pack n' play.

We were nervous because it was such a large purchase for us. (This is the most expensive thing we have purchased besides our car.) After extensive research we decided on the babybjorn because my husband is in graduate school and we will be doing a lot of moving in the next few years. She has slept in it since she was three days old and she is now seven months and the crib looks and functions as if it was new!Our BabyBjorn has been in six states and five countries. We have checked it at airports all over Europe and the US. We have checked it in its carrying case alone and it has not been damaged in anyway. It has been on trains, buses, metros, trams, in taxis, cars, and planes! Even the bag has yet to show signs of wearing.The crib unzips from the metal bars so it can be washed as well. This is really nice if you travel a lot. We moved into our apartment in Italy and found out that there were bed bugs in it! We were worried we would have to replace our loved crib but it can be washed and the matress is cased in plastic so it is safe. (The plastic liner can unzip and both the matress and the plastic can be washed.) If you are planning on doing any extensive traveling you will run into bed bugs and this crib is a must.The sheets and matress pad made by babybjorn are expensive however I found them for half the price at sheetworld.com. And we were able to get hot pink cotton ones and hot pink flannel ones.The crib is so easy to put together. I personally hate setting things up but it is one motion - just lifting it out of the case! It also comes ready-to-go so no need to put together. It even is easy to put back into its case. Amazingly, seven months plus six countries later it still opens up perfectly everytime.I love that I can see into it so easily through the mesh. Being a first time mom I was super nervous when she slept but I could see her without lifting my head off the pillow. Also, our little one moves a lot while she sleeps and sometimes ends up pressed against the side. Luckily the babybjorn is light fabric so she can breath while her face is planted into the side. Another great thing is that all the bars are outside of the crib so there is nothing hard for her little head to hit.Durning the night she sleeps in it and during the day she plays in it. Unlike pack n' plays the bottom will not sag because the matress is supported by the floor.Also, it is small enough to fit in tight hotel rooms and even on some trains but large enough to provide comfort and space for even the most wiggley babies! The carrying case is also slim enough for us to pack it on the floor of our Saturn in front of her car seat. It even was smashed in our trunk from Washington DC to Idaho and worked just fine when we pulled it out.Two things about it to keep in mind. The crib sits on the floor so it is cooler at the lower elevation than a traditonal crib. Also, I had a c-section and it was difficult for the first week to bend over and lift her out of it. However the crib has been built well enough that I do lean on it to grab her and it has not had any issues.It is hands down the best purchase we made.

Several people reported that this car seat was so snug that, in some cases, it actually harmed their baby. In one instance, an individual claimed that the seat was so restrictive that it would not even fit their newborn. Having used the carrier myself, I now believe that the product has been altered since those reviews were written, those reviewers did not read the user&#8217;s manual, and/or those folks were just out to write a negative review for what is actually an amazing product. It is true that the Maxi Cosi Prezi is cozy; but cozy in a warm hug way, not in a reticulated python way.We received this seat late in the game. My child was already 18 pounds 6 ounces and 27 and-a-half inches long. Not a huge baby, but much larger than the newborn that others claimed having trouble squeezing into the seat. He fit like a glove, and loved it. Yes, I did have to adjust the straps and take out the included newborn wedge, which required almost no effort compared to some carriers. This adjustment, however, would be required of any baby carrier unless it just happened to be adjusted to the size of one&#8217;s child right out of the box.Our other carrier is the Britax Chaperone, and is my point of comparison. After making the mistake of originally purchasing a much cheaper carrier prior to my child&#8217;s birth, I can confidently say that both the Britax and the Maxi Cosi are of superior material and build quality than carriers on the lower end of the cost scale. I only mention this because I am admittedly and, if you ask my wife, painfully cheap. Nonetheless, there is a discernable difference in quality for the price in this case. When one&#8217;s child is involved, in my opinion, it is worth the extra expense.One feature present on the Maxi Cosi that originally prompted me to purchase the Britax, is a rear impact bar (I think Maxi Cosi refers to it as an anti-rebound bar) on the car seat base. While it blows my mind that this feature is not required on all infant car seats, it is only seen on a couple of models. The purpose of this bar is that of preventing the rear-facing car seat from smashing the contained baby&#8217;s head and face against the seat of the car it is attached to in a rear impact, or recoil from front impact, situation. For first time parents, I recommend that you try some car seats without this feature in your own car (without a baby in it, of course) and see for yourself how easily the base and seat fold up against the seat they are attached to if the weight is shifted as it would be in a rear impact scenario. Then try the seats with the bar. Again, ridiculous that this feature is not a requirement. Big points for both this seat and the Chaperone.The primary difference, in my book, between my two favorite car seats &#8211; this seat and the Chaperone &#8211; is that the Maxi Cosi is substantially lighter than the Chaperone. The Chaperone&#8217;s big claim being safety, I just cannot say for sure whether any safety is sacrificed for the sake of weight. Other differences include the multiple travel systems offered by Britax for Britax carriers, whereas it seems that Maxi Cosi is following more of a universal adapter approach. It might seem insignificant but the Prezi also has this piece of elastic fabric that stretches across the infant occupant&#8217;s feet that seems to produce a calming effect. Very nice. The same type of fabric serves as the European style canopy. My wife prefers this canopy, I do not.All in all, I believe the Maxi Cosi Prezi is a legitimate top tier product that easily competes with the trusted standards in the industry. As far as comfort is concerned, I have not personally seen a carrier that my own child has looked more comfortable in. In my opinion, any claims that the Maxi Cosi Prezi is too cozy are simply false within the context of the recommended weight and height restrictions."},{"value":"1.0"},{"value":"[-233.6875590945047,233.6875590945047]"},{"value":"1.0"}],[{"value":"Pura Stainless Kiki Sippy Bottle Stainless Steel, 11 Ounce, Natural"},{"value":"We have four of these bottles for our twins - one plain stainless, as well as green, pink and aqua bottles.  We love them: they are eco-friendly, sturdy, attractive and durable, and the colours allow our twins to distinguish which bottle is theirs.However, my kids don't like the Pura sippy spouts.  Instead we started out using Mam wide mouth nipples, then transitioned to Avent sippy spouts.  I would really like it if there were a silicone straw top option for these sippy cups -Zo-li Bot Straw Sippy Cupsare the best straw option I have found, but those cups are plastic.Addressing some criticisms in other reviews (here and in reviews for other finishes):1) Liquid measurements - The interior of the bottle is marked in ounces and mL.  It is hard to see the markings when the bottle is empty, but as soon as you start filling it with milk any overhead light reflects off the surface of the milk and makes it much easier to see the markings.  I've found that with time I got very good at estimating amounts just by glancing into the bottle.  If you really need to track every half ounce that your child consumes, stainless bottles are not going to be the best option.2) Heat transfer / durability - We useSiliskinsto cover our bottles, protect our children's hands from heat and cold, and protect the bottles from dings when they are inevitably dropped.  At the time I got my bottles the Pura skins weren't available through Amazon.  Our bottles have endured numerous drops from toddler height and from a 42 inch high counter and they are as good as new.3) Paint flaking - This has been noted as an issue by some reviewers who used the coloured bottles.  Well, we did an A/B test... my son has nails like Wolverine and sure enough he scratched his bottles; my daughter is far more gentle and has never scratched her bottles.  Choose a stainless or coloured bottle according to your own child's tendencies...  The Siliskins also help to protect the paint since they prevent scratching.4) Silicone caps - at first these seemed weird but I grew to like them.  They do fit securely but aren't as secure as screw-on lids would be: I wouldn't recommend inverting the bottles and hoping that they don't leak.  The upside to not being rigid is that they squish easily into a pocket or corner of the diaper bag when you've taken them off the bottle, and with twins every square inch of space counts.This is a great product.  If I were adding to my wishlist of features and accessories I can only say it would also be nice to have a wider range of colours (Pura has added Grape to their line-up since we bought our bottles; yellow, red and orange would be great additions).  In addition to the straw top, as another reviewer mentioned, an adult sport spout would also be a great thing to have.  Pura could also offer screw-on stainless caps for people who hate the silicone caps.  Finally, since the colours are so attractive it seems a shame to cover them with coloured silicone covers - clear covers would allow the bottles to show through more attractively."},{"value":"1.0"},{"value":"[-233.08469758394472,233.08469758394472]"},{"value":"1.0"}]],"columnNames":[{"name":"name","index":0,"aggr":"sum"},{"name":"review","index":1,"aggr":"sum"},{"name":"sentiment","index":2,"aggr":"sum"},{"name":"rawPrediction","index":3,"aggr":"sum"},{"name":"prediction","index":4,"aggr":"sum"}],"rows":[["Britax B-Ready Stroller, Black","\"Some differences with Uppababy Vs.

I can see that they would get all scratched up easily. B-Ready also had fenders on them which seem to add to bulk. Comparing closely it almost appear one could put Vista's wheels to B-Ready.  It's that similar!HANDLE - B-Ready wins. Handle on B-Ready was nicer than Vista. It pivoted instead of telescoping (which was what the Vista does). The center was had a grip that was molded for one-handed steering. The arms and wrist seem more comfortable (rested more parallel like on a keyboard). My wife at 5'2 found the Vista handle too high and wished it could adjust lower.FOLDING - Vista wins (barely). Comparing the two, the wife like the Vista (it did take several attempts for wife to get the feel for it, as did I ! Once figured out it was ok).B-Ready  required two hands as well but you sort of have to use your stomach so that you could pull the levers toward you and have  it collapse. I found it easy if you have larger hands you can pull down the levers easier but since my wife is 5'2, her hands are smaller and sort of used her stomach a bit.

Several people reported that this car seat was so snug that, in some cases, it actually harmed their baby. In one instance, an individual claimed that the seat was so restrictive that it would not even fit their newborn. Having used the carrier myself, I now believe that the product has been altered since those reviews were written, those reviewers did not read the user&#8217;s manual, and/or those folks were just out to write a negative review for what is actually an amazing product. It is true that the Maxi Cosi Prezi is cozy; but cozy in a warm hug way, not in a reticulated python way.We received this seat late in the game. My child was already 18 pounds 6 ounces and 27 and-a-half inches long. Not a huge baby, but much larger than the newborn that others claimed having trouble squeezing into the seat. He fit like a glove, and loved it. Yes, I did have to adjust the straps and take out the included newborn wedge, which required almost no effort compared to some carriers. This adjustment, however, would be required of any baby carrier unless it just happened to be adjusted to the size of one&#8217;s child right out of the box.Our other carrier is the Britax Chaperone, and is my point of comparison. After making the mistake of originally purchasing a much cheaper carrier prior to my child&#8217;s birth, I can confidently say that both the Britax and the Maxi Cosi are of superior material and build quality than carriers on the lower end of the cost scale. I only mention this because I am admittedly and, if you ask my wife, painfully cheap. Nonetheless, there is a discernable difference in quality for the price in this case. When one&#8217;s child is involved, in my opinion, it is worth the extra expense.One feature present on the Maxi Cosi that originally prompted me to purchase the Britax, is a rear impact bar (I think Maxi Cosi refers to it as an anti-rebound bar) on the car seat base. While it blows my mind that this feature is not required on all infant car seats, it is only seen on a couple of models. The purpose of this bar is that of preventing the rear-facing car seat from smashing the contained baby&#8217;s head and face against the seat of the car it is attached to in a rear impact, or recoil from front impact, situation. For first time parents, I recommend that you try some car seats without this feature in your own car (without a baby in it, of course) and see for yourself how easily the base and seat fold up against the seat they are attached to if the weight is shifted as it would be in a rear impact scenario. Then try the seats with the bar. Again, ridiculous that this feature is not a requirement. Big points for both this seat and the Chaperone.The primary difference, in my book, between my two favorite car seats &#8211; this seat and the Chaperone &#8211; is that the Maxi Cosi is substantially lighter than the Chaperone. The Chaperone&#8217;s big claim being safety, I just cannot say for sure whether any safety is sacrificed for the sake of weight. Other differences include the multiple travel systems offered by Britax for Britax carriers, whereas it seems that Maxi Cosi is following more of a universal adapter approach. It might seem insignificant but the Prezi also has this piece of elastic fabric that stretches across the infant occupant&#8217;s feet that seems to produce a calming effect. Very nice. The same type of fabric serves as the European style canopy. My wife prefers this canopy, I do not.All in all, I believe the Maxi Cosi Prezi is a legitimate top tier product that easily competes with the trusted standards in the industry. As far as comfort is concerned, I have not personally seen a carrier that my own child has looked more comfortable in. In my opinion, any claims that the Maxi Cosi Prezi is too cozy are simply false within the context of the recommended weight and height restrictions.","1.0","[-233.6875590945047,233.6875590945047]","1.0"],["Pura Stainless Kiki Sippy Bottle Stainless Steel, 11 Ounce, Natural","We have four of these bottles for our twins - one plain stainless, as well as green, pink and aqua bottles.  We love them: they are eco-friendly, sturdy, attractive and durable, and the colours allow our twins to distinguish which bottle is theirs.However, my kids don't like the Pura sippy spouts.  Instead we started out using Mam wide mouth nipples, then transitioned to Avent sippy spouts.  I would really like it if there were a silicone straw top option for these sippy cups -Zo-li Bot Straw Sippy Cupsare the best straw option I have found, but those cups are plastic.Addressing some criticisms in other reviews (here and in reviews for other finishes):1) Liquid measurements - The interior of the bottle is marked in ounces and mL.  It is hard to see the markings when the bottle is empty, but as soon as you start filling it with milk any overhead light reflects off the surface of the milk and makes it much easier to see the markings.  I've found that with time I got very good at estimating amounts just by glancing into the bottle.  If you really need to track every half ounce that your child consumes, stainless bottles are not going to be the best option.2) Heat transfer / durability - We useSiliskinsto cover our bottles, protect our children's hands from heat and cold, and protect the bottles from dings when they are inevitably dropped.  At the time I got my bottles the Pura skins weren't available through Amazon.  Our bottles have endured numerous drops from toddler height and from a 42 inch high counter and they are as good as new.3) Paint flaking - This has been noted as an issue by some reviewers who used the coloured bottles.  Well, we did an A/B test... my son has nails like Wolverine and sure enough he scratched his bottles; my daughter is far more gentle and has never scratched her bottles.  Choose a stainless or coloured bottle according to your own child's tendencies...  The Siliskins also help to protect the paint since they prevent scratching.4) Silicone caps - at first these seemed weird but I grew to like them.  They do fit securely but aren't as secure as screw-on lids would be: I wouldn't recommend inverting the bottles and hoping that they don't leak.  The upside to not being rigid is that they squish easily into a pocket or corner of the diaper bag when you've taken them off the bottle, and with twins every square inch of space counts.This is a great product.  If I were adding to my wishlist of features and accessories I can only say it would also be nice to have a wider range of colours (Pura has added Grape to their line-up since we bought our bottles; yellow, red and orange would be great additions).  In addition to the straw top, as another reviewer mentioned, an adult sport spout would also be a great thing to have.  Pura could also offer screw-on stainless caps for people who hate the silicone caps.  Finally, since the colours are so attractive it seems a shame to cover them with coloured silicone covers - clear covers would allow the bottles to show through more attractively.","1.0","[-233.08469758394472,233.08469758394472]","1.0"]]},"dateCreated":"2017-01-29T04:47:25-0800","dateStarted":"2017-01-29T10:28:15-0800","dateFinished":"2017-01-29T10:29:55-0800","status":"FINISHED","progressUpdateIntervalMs":500,"$$hashKey":"object:296"},{"text":"%md\n# Evaluation of Prediction\n\nAgain we want to assess the performance of the prediction model.
